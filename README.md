### What is Regex Expression 

Javascript has many methods that tell us if a string contains a certain character or term. Take a look at this example below.
'Ruben Castro is the Shift Lead' ends with ('Shift Lead')
This method is ok most of the time but it does have some flaws. What if you needed to find a string with have the word "Shif Leads" and not just one "Shift Leads". These issues can be solved with additional statements that go more in depth and require parameter that you want, or you can turn them into a regular expression and make it easy for you. 

### Summary 

Regular Expressions, also known as Regex are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. Regex lets you search and manupilate text strings. Regex is good because it saves you alot of time when writing code.
